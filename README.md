# GEOSC-376: Introduction to Python for Modeling Earth & Climate Systems 

#### Course Description
Python is a powerful tool for analyzing data and modeling Earth and environmental systems. In this course students will be introduced to basic Python functions and common Python packages used for cleaning, analyzing and visualizing datasets. Following an introduction to Python, students will learn how numerical models are used to simulate a variety of Earth Science processes, coupled with an overview of the scientific principles that underlie such models. Modeling projects will focus on topics such as groundwater flow and transport, climate and atmosphere simulations, and glacial dynamics.

#### Prerequisites
100-level Principles of Geoscience plus a 200-level Geoscience course or Permission of Instructor. 

#### Course Objectives
•	Use common Python functions from libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to manipulate, visualize, and analyze data\
•	Write clear, well-annotated code that can yield easily reproducible results\
•	Retrieve large datasets from online repositories and perform unique analyses in Python\
•	Analyze output from geoscience based numerical models to come to process based conclusions\

#### Course Materials
There is no assigned textbook for this course. Readings will be pulled from a variety of sources and made available on Blackboard. In addition, we will use Google Colab (https://colab.google/) for much of the course. Google Colab is an online service that hosts Jupyter Notebooks, in which you can write and visualize Python code. Google Colab will work with your Hamilton College Google Drive, creating a folder for you within your drive once you create your first notebook. You will share your Colab folder with me so that I can grade your assignments and provide you with timely feedback.
