# GEOSC-376-PYTHON-MODELING-EARTH-SYSTEMS

#### Introduction to Python for Modeling Earth & Climate Systems

Course Description: Python is a powerful tool for analyzing data and modeling Earth and environmental systems. In this course students will be introduced to basic Python functions and common Python packages used for cleaning, analyzing and visualizing datasets. Following an introduction to Python, students will learn how numerical models are used to simulate a variety of Earth Science processes, coupled with an overview of the scientific principles that underlie such models. Modeling projects will focus on topics such as groundwater flow and transport, climate and atmosphere simulations, and glacial dynamics.
